# Sora 2 + n8n: Hollywood-Quality Video Ad Generator

Turn a single product photo into a cinematic, high-converting video ad — powered by Sora 2, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and n8n.

---

## Overview
This project automates the entire AI video ad creation pipeline.  
Upload a product photo → AI analyzes it → writes a cinematic prompt → generates a professional CGI video ad → uploads and stores everything automatically.

You’ll learn how to orchestrate AI video production using n8n, OpenRouter, Google Drive, Baserow, and Kie.ai’s Sora 2.

Perfect for AI automation engineers, no-code builders, and creative studios that want to scale ads with AI.

## How It Works

### 1. Form Submission
Trigger: `FormTrigger` node  
Collects:
- Product photo  
- Aspect ratio (portrait or landscape)  
- Short description  

Uploads instantly start the workflow.

---

### 2. Upload to Google Drive
The uploaded photo is saved in a “Product Photos” Drive folder.  
A shareable link (`webContentLink`) is passed forward for analysis and Sora input.

---

### 3. Product Image Analysis (GPT-4o)
GPT-4o performs a YAML-based structured analysis of the product image:
- Ignores background and props  
- Extracts materials, colors (with HEX codes), textures, and logos  
- Outputs an exhaustive YAML object describing only the product  

This gives later nodes a complete understanding of the subject.

---

### 4. Creative Direction (Gemini 2.5 Pro)
Gemini generates a Sora 2-compatible cinematic timeline prompt:
- Defines Vibe, Format, and Genre  
- Writes a 0–12s Timeline Breakdown:
  - [0–3s] Hook  
  - [3–6s] Context  
  - [6–9s] Climax  
  - [9–12s] Resolution  
- Includes camera motion, lighting cues, emotion, and sound design  

This step turns raw data into a film director’s script.

---

### 5. Sora 2 Video Generation (via Kie.ai)
The cinematic prompt, image URL, and aspect ratio are passed into the  
“Kie.ai Sora 2 Image → Video” workflow, which returns a CGI-style product ad.  

Result: A cinematic, UGC-style commercial generated in minutes.

---

### 6. File Management
- Video is downloaded via HTTP Request node  
- Uploaded to Google Drive “Product Videos” folder  
- Metadata (image, video, status, description) logged in Baserow  

Every output is archived, searchable, and ready to share.
